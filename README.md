# Your Process and Team

- How much do you reuse from project to project?

- Who commisions the work?

- Who designs the interactivity?

- Do developers contribute to the design process? If so, is it in a formalized way?

- Do your JS developers do a lot of work in CSS?

- What do the review cycles look like? Are the products continually updated after release?

- How do you know if what you've built is effective? Do you collect feedback or analytics? Do you correlate the release of a new tool with changes in performance indicators?

- What is it like working with offshore talent? Any recurring issues? Late nights/early mornings?
